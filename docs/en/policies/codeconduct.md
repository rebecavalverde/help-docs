## Code of Conduct 

We all love music! 

Like any community, we have a code of behavior to maintain harmony, good vibes and make sure we all feel comfortable here. Let’s build a friendly environment that inspires us to create. 

### Principles of coexistence

1. Respect
2. Fellowship
3. Equity

### Expected behavior

* Treat all members with respect.
* Constructive feedback is welcome.
* It’s all about music so let’s keep our comments and content related to this only.
* Treat others the way you like to be treated.

### Unacceptable behavior (we can delete your account without warning)

* Treating our fellow creators disrespectfully or offensively.
* Spam.
* Sharing sexual content.
* Make comments intended to degrade, offend, or annoy any member of the community.

## Public actions:

### Reasons to be immediately banned

* Share sexual content of any kind (images, comments, etc.).
* Share content or make comments that encourage violence, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, etc.
* Spam others.

### Other kinds of unacceptable behavior

Insult or post demeaning comments to any of the members of the community:

* 1st time: we will disable the ability to make comments until further notice.
* 2d time: we will **permanently** disable the ability to comment or delete your account.

Spam support:

* Our support team will always be happy to help you as long as you respectfully write to us exclusively regarding our platform. **Disrespectful or spammy attitudes are not welcome** and may result in the deletion of your account. If you do not behave appropriately, it is certain that you will not receive assistance. 

### What is a disrespectful comment?

This type of comment is usually irrelevant, inappropriate, detrimental, or just annoying. The person does not write it with a kindly disposition, and it is aimed to make the other person feel bad or humiliated. 

**If you are not sure whether your comment is disrespectful or not, avoid posting it and find a respectful and civilized way to express yourself**.
