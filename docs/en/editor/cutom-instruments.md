The custom instruments allow you to create your own instruments configurations and save them in your Flat accounts. These instruments can be then be used when creating a new score or when changing instruments in your existing documents. Create and manage them [in your account settings](https://flat.io/settings/account/instruments).

Below, you can learn how to create the configurations for:
* [Pitched instruments](#pitched-instruments)
* [Unpitched instruments](#unpitched-instruments)

## Pitched instruments

Custom **pitched instruments** allows you to create a complete configuration of your instruments:

### 1. Base instrument

You can choose first an **base instrument** to build your custom instrument. Choose a base instrument to quickly re-use all the settings from an instrument and only change the settings you want. *For example*, if you only want to only have a custom name, always use a specific tuning on your TAB, or create an instrument with a different transposition mode.

### 2. Staves and Clefs

Choose the **staves and clefs** of your instrument.

### 3. Transposition mode

Choose then the **transposition mode**: the note and octave. If your instrument is non-transposing (plays in concert pitch), choose **C** and **0**.

### 4. Tablature configuration

You can then completely configure the **tablature** of the instrument. Choose first **how many strings** your plucked string instrument has (at this time we allow from 4 to 14 strings), its **complete tuning and capo**.

### 5. Sound

Choose finally the **sound** of the instrument for our playback.

### 6. Part name and abbreviation

Set the default part name and abbreviation that will be printed on your scores.

## Unpitched instruments

Custom **unpitched instruments** (in beta) include the staves settings, different percussion elements, their mapping and keyboard shortcuts to use them.

### 1. Base instrument

You can choose first an base instrument to build your custom instrument. Choose a base instrument to quickly re-use all the settings from an instrument and only change the settings you want. *For example*, if you want to make small changes to our preset drumset, you can start your custom drumset from our configuration.

### 2. Number of lines for your staves

Choose if your unpitched part will have **staves with 1 or 5 lines**.

### 3. How to create a rhythmic score with one stave 

If you want to create a rhythmic score with one stave you need to create a score with an unpitched instrument with one stave.

### 4. Percussions instruments for your kit

You can then choose all the percussions instruments you want to include in the part:

* Pick up a percussion instruments in the list
* Set the **staff line** from 0.5 to 5.5 for 5 lines (0 is at the bottom, 5 at the top), or 0.5 to 1.5 for single-line staves.
* Choose the **note head** you want to assign to the instrument.
* Optionally, you can set a **custom keyboard shortcut** for the instrument. For example, if you choose "*X*" for a closed hi-hat, when you will press "*X*" whiled editing the notation of the part, it will insert a note for the closed hi-hat with the chosen line and note head.

If you play an instrument different ways (e.g. Open and Closed Hi-hat), add all the playing ways to the configuration with different lines and/or different heads.
