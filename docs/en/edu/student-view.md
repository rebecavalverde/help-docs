As soon as your students have an account on the platform, they will be able to create score and practice on their own. This section is meant to help you understand what they will see while you interact with them.

We will show what they see when:

* [You add them to a class](#class-and-student-stream)
* [They work on an assignment](#work-on-an-assignment)
* [They want to turn in their work](#turn-in-an-existing-score-for-an-assignment)

## Class and student stream

When you add a student to a class, they will see it from their dashboard view.

![Student classes](/help/assets/img/edu/class-student-list.png)

From this view, they will be able to open a class and see everything shared in it.

![Class Stream](/help/assets/img/edu/class-student-stream.png)

Once a class is open, the student will be able to see the ongoing assignment if there are any. 
They will also be able to see the different posts written by the teacher

## Work on an assignment

From the class view, a student can decide to start or continue a given assignment.
Let's say that they click on the "First assignment" shown on the screen above.

In this view, the student will be able to read the teacher's instruction and click on "**Start assignment**".

**Hint:** When they start a new assignment, a score will be automatically created and named in their library.

Once the student is done with the assignment, they can press turn-in.

The information will be automatically added; the student can leave a comment about their work for the teacher to read when reviewing.

## Turn in an existing score for an assignment

Most of the time a student will start an assignment with a new score or a template you shared with them.
In some cases, they might need to send a score they already have in their account, or an extra score.
Here is a complete breakdown of how to do it.

First, they need to open their Flat account, choose the class then the assignment as shown above.
Once they arrive on the assignment page, they will see the "**Your work**" section on the right side of the page or below the instructions.

![Your work](/help/assets/img/edu/class-student-your-work-template-default.png)

They can click on "**Add an existing score**" and choose your score from their library.

![Started assignment](/help/assets/img/edu/class-student-your-work-template-started.png)

Then click on "**Turn in**" to send their work. That's all! You will receive a notification and will be able to review their work.

## Edit a submitted assignment 

Once the student has turned in the assignment, he/she will be able to edit it and add pre-existing or new scores to the assignment. To do so, he/she must go to the desired assignemt, click on edit, make the necessary changes and click on "**Turn in**" again.
